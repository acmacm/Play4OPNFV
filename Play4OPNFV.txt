##  Old Neil Young "Plays for OPNFV"  ##

ttto: I am a Child

Verse
Dm     C         Am               F
I am a Committer,  some call me a Submitter
Dm                  F               C               Em
Jenkins SUCCESS and Merge  make me feel a whole lot better!
Dm             C       Am             F
We review our tickets,  but time runs short,
Dm            Dm7                      D
and Milestone exceptions are our last resort!

Chorus
Dm7                        Em7/D        D
 I pull your commits,  now you pull for me,
G                                 D
We want to complete   our feature list
Dm7                         Em7/D             D
 The sky is blue,  but it's midnight and I can't see
Am7                             C          
What is the color,  of Functest PASSing?
            Am7     D
What is the color? 


Verse
Dm     C         Am            F
I'm a P-T-L,       I'll last a while,
Dm          F                C             Em
When I step down,  you'll be blinded by my smile
Dm              C    Am              F
When Milestones near,   I'll bang my head,
Dm        Dm7                 D
until the Release   is put to bed...

Chorus
Dm7                        Em7/D        D
 I Review for you, now you review   for me.
G                              D
I need to merge   your Rebased patch.
Dm7                         Em7/D             D
 The sky is blue,  but it's midnight and I can't see
Am7                             C 
What is the color,  of Functest PASSing?
            Am7     D
What is the color?

D              C                F                       G

D           A              G           D      
We've been through,   many Releases together
Bm             G         D      A 
with trunks of memories, yet to see.
D             A            G      D   
We found work-arounds   in stormy weather.
Bm       A       D
cause  I play for O-P N-F V !!

Long may our code run, Long may code run,
Bm             G            A 
Although these changes have come 
D                       A
With our silver laptops shinin'  
G      D         Bm         A     D   G 
in the Sun.    Long may   OP-NFV run.
